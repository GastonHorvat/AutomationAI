      so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
    </p>
    <p>

      faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of
      the law or comply with legal process served on us; (b) protect and defend our

      functionality and may help us analyze web traffic. We may use session cookies
      (which expire once you close your web browser) and/or persistent cookies
      (which stay on your device until you delete them). You can instruct your
      browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
